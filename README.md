# Airbnb-Summarizer-App
# Airbnb Investment Analysis Using LLMs

## Overview
This document outlines a strategic approach to leverage LlamaIndex and Langchain capabilities for transforming Airbnb reviews into structured insights. These insights are crucial for Airbnb investors, providing them with comprehensive analysis and data-driven decision-making tools.

## Strategy for Extracting Insights
We focus on several key areas:

### 1. Property Performance Metrics
- **Objective**: Identify and quantify sentiment expressions and correlate them with property features.
- **Method**: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

### 2. Investment Potential Indicators
- **Objective**: Gauge desirability based on amenities and attractions.
- **Method**: Detect and classify mentions, assessing frequency and sentiment.

### 3. Trend Analysis
- **Objective**: Capture trends and seasonality effects in sentiment.
- **Method**: Analyze sentiment over time, focusing on pre- and post-event changes.

### 4. Comparative Insights
- **Objective**: Establish local market trends through comparative analysis.
- **Method**: Aggregate and compare property features within specific locales.

### 5. Location Desirability
- **Objective**: Evaluate appeal based on location, transportation, and neighborhood.
- **Method**: Extract and categorize relevant comments.

### 6. Host Quality Indicators
- **Objective**: Gauge host impact on guest satisfaction.
- **Method**: Analyze review sentiments associated with each host.

Integrating these features involves developing specific LLM prompts for targeted information extraction.

## Integrating LlamaIndex and OpenAI API
To integrate LlamaIndex's structured data extraction with your Airbnb summarizer app:

1. **Define Output Schema**:
   - Create Pydantic models for structured data extraction from reviews.

2. **Use Function Calling**:
   - Leverage LlamaIndex's function calling feature to structure review text.

3. **Run Program for Structured Output**:
   - Utilize OpenAIPydanticProgram for converting summaries to structured data.

4. **Automate Workflows**:
   - Integrate summarization and data extraction processes into existing Python code for automation.

## Structuring Insights in a Database
Considering the use of PostgreSQL and pgvector, structure the insights in a columnar format:

### Property Performance Metrics
- **Columns**: Property ID, Average Rating, Booking Frequency, Positive Sentiment Score, Negative Sentiment Score, Common Keywords.
- **Description**: Metrics and phrases indicating property popularity or issues.

### Investment Potential Indicators
- **Columns**: Property ID, Amenities (as a JSON array or similar), Attraction Proximity, Amenity Sentiment Score.
- **Description**: Lists of amenities and their desirability ratings.

### Trend Analysis
- **Columns**: Property ID, Date, Sentiment Score, Seasonal Trend Identifier.
- **Description**: Time-stamped sentiment scores to track trends and seasonal effects.

### Comparative Insights
- **Columns**: Zipcode/Geohash, Average Bedrooms, Average Bathrooms, Average Rating.
- **Description**: Aggregate data per geographic area for market comparison.

### Location Desirability
- **Columns**: Property ID, Transport Links Rating, Neighborhood Quality Rating, Nearby Attractions.
- **Description**: Ratings and descriptions of location-related factors.

### Host Quality Indicators
- **Columns**: Host ID, Average Guest Satisfaction Score, Positive/Negative Review Count.
- **Description**: Metrics to evaluate host performance once you have host identification data.

This structure will help in effectively querying, analyzing, and visualizing the data, providing valuable insights to investors. Each column should be designed to store the most relevant data type (numeric, text, JSON, etc.), ensuring efficient data processing and retrieval.
